          # Plabayo News API

          We're planning to have a first alpha release ready of a read-only API
          with access to _all public content_ of Plabayo News, meaning all
          submissions, comments and public profiles.

          You can already today reach out to us at [pn@plabayo.tech](mailto:pn@plabayo.tech)
          with a formal request of this API in which you'll have to explain your motivation for the data,
          its purpose and a bit more about you or your organization who'll consume the data.

          We'll open release to this API to a couple of you as a first test
          between Q2 an Q3 of 2022.

    questions:
      format: md
      value: |
        ### Are there rules about submissions and comments?

        You can consult them in [the Plabayo News Guidelines page](/guidelines).

        ### How are stories ranked?

        To be determined...

        ### How is a user's karma calculated?

        To be determined...

        ### Do posts by users with more karma rank higher?

        No.

        ### Why don't I see down arrows (to down vote)?

        There are no down arrows on stories. They appear on comments after users reach a certain karma threshold, but never on direct replies.

        ### What kind of formatting can you use in comments?

        For now nothing. In the future we might consider something
        simple in the spirit of <http://news.ycombinator.com/formatdoc>.

        ### How do I submit a question?

        To be determined...

        ### How do I make a link in a text submission?

        You can't. This is to prevent people from submitting a link with their comments in a
        privileged position at the top of the page. If you want to submit a link with comments,
        just submit it, then add a regular comment.

        Links within comments appear as plain text.

        ### What are Ask Plabayo News and Show Plabayo News?

        Ask Plabayo News (PN) lists questions and other text submissions.
        Show Plabayo News PN) is for sharing your personal work and has special rules.

        ### Why hasn't my submission appeared on Ask PN or Show PN?

        All Ask PNs appear on [newest](/newest) and [asknew](/asknew),
        and all Show HNs on [newest](/newest) and [shownew](/shownew)
        but there is a small points threshold before a post makes it to [ask](/ask) or [show](/show).

        ### What do green usernames mean?

        Green indicates a new account.

        ### Why are some comments faded?

        Faded text means that a comment has been down voted.
        You can read the comment in normal text by clicking on its timestamp to go to its page.

        ### What does `[flagged]` mean?

        Users flagged the post as breaking [the guidelines](/guidelines) or otherwise not belonging on Plabayo news.

        Moderators sometimes also add `[flagged]` (though not usually on submissions), and sometimes turn flags off when they are unfair.

        ### How do I flag a comment?

        Click on its timestamp to go to its page, then click the 'flag' link at the top.
        
        There's a small karma threshold before flag links appear.

        ### What does `[banned]` mean?

        The post was banned by user flags, or moderators.

        Banned posts aren't displayed by default, but you can see them all by turning on 'show hidden submissions' in your profile.

        If you see a `[banned]` post that shouldn't be banned, you can vouch for it. Click on its timestamp to go to its page,
        then click 'vouch' at the top. When enough users do this, the post is restored.
        
        There's a small karma threshold before vouch links appear.

        ### What does `[deleted]` mean?

        The author deleted the post outright, or asked us to. Unlike dead posts, these remain deleted even when 'show hidden submissions' is turned on.

        ### Are reposts ok?

        If a story has not had significant attention in the last year or so, a small number of reposts is ok.

        Otherwise we bury reposts as duplicates.

        Please don't delete and repost the same story.
        Deletion is for things that shouldn't have been submitted in the first place.

        ### Are paywalls ok?

        It's ok to post stories from sites with paywalls that have workarounds.

        In comments, it's ok to ask how to read an article and to help other users do so.
        But please don't post complaints about paywalls. Those are off topic. More here.

        ### Can I ask people to upvote my submission?

        No. Users should vote for a story because they personally find it intellectually interesting,
        not because someone has content to promote.
        
        We penalize or ban submissions, accounts, and sites that break this rule, so please don't.

        ### Can I ask people to comment on my submission?

        No, for the same reason. It's also not in your interest:
        readers are sensitive to this and will detect it, flag it, and use unkind words like 'spam'.

        ### Why can't I post a comment to a thread?

        Threads are closed to new comments after two weeks,
        or if the submission has been killed by software, moderators, or user flags.

        ### Why is A ranked below B even though A has more points and is newer?

        You can't derive rank from votes and time alone. See "How are stories ranked?" above.

        ### How do I reset my password?

        To be determined...

        ### Can I make my profile public?

        By default your profile is hidden and only your anonymous numerical identifier is shown.
        However you can mark your public profile in your profile settings in which
        case everyone can see your profile.

        ### Can I change my username?

        You can change your optional username. By default this username is empty
        in which case your anonymous identifier is shown instead.

        Changing this username can be done by yourself in your profile.

        ### Can I delete my account?

        We try not to delete entire account histories because that would gut the threads the account had participated in.
        
        However, we care about protecting individual users and take care of privacy requests every day,
        so if we can help, please email [pn@plabayo.tech](mailto:pn@plabayo.tech).
        
        We don't want anyone to get in trouble from anything they posted to Plabayo News.

        The easiest you can do for yourself immediately is to mark your profile as hidden.
        This ensures your profile information is wiped and only your anonymous username is shown.

        ### My IP address seems to be banned. How can I unban it?

        Please email to [security@plabayo.tech](mailto:security@plabayo.tech).

        # Plabayo News Guidelines

        On this page you find a summary of the guidelines which the moderators
        adhere to in order to keep this a respectful place to grow together.

        Plabayo News only works as well as its community works. If you would like to add things
        to the guidelines, change or remove existing guidelines, than please start a discussion
        or contribute to an ongoing discussion at <https://github.com/plabayo/news/discussions/categories/ideas>.

        ### What to Submit

        On-Topic: Anything that other caregivers and other community members would find interesting.

        That includes more parenting guides and hands-on articles.
        If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be:
        anything that gratifies one's intellectual and emotional curiosity.

        The goal is for us to grow on all levels, and help us to be kind to ourselves and one another,
        with respect, an open mind and the space for all of us to grow individually as well as together.

        Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon.
        Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures.
        
        If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.

        ### In Submissions

        - Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points,
          or saying how great an article is. It's implicit in submitting something that you think it's important.
        - Please submit the original source.
          - If a post reports on something found on another site, submit the latter.
          - If the title includes the name of the site, please take it out, because the site name will be displayed after the link.
        - If you submit a video or pdf, please warn us by appending `[video]` or `[pdf]` to the title.
        - If the title contains a gratuitous number or number + adjective, we'd appreciate it if you'd crop it.
          - E.g. translate "10 Ways To Do X" to "How To Do X," and "14 Amazing Ys" to "Ys."
          - Exception: when the number is meaningful, e.g. "The 5 Platonic Solids."
        - Otherwise please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don't editorialize.
        - Please don't post on Plabayo NEws to ask or tell us something.
          - Instead start or participate in a discussion at <https://github.com/plabayo/news/discussions/categories/general>.
        - Please don't delete and repost.
          - Deletion is for things that shouldn't have been submitted in the first place.
        - Please don't use Plabayo News primarily for promotion.
          - It's ok to post your own stuff occasionally, but the primary use of the site should be for curiosity.
        - Don't solicit upvotes, comments, or submissions.
          - Users should vote and comment when they run across something they personally find interesting—not for promotion.

        ### In Comments

        - Be kind.
        - Don't be snarky.
        - Have curious conversation;
        - don't cross-examine.
        - Please don't fulminate.
        - Please don't sneer, including at the rest of the community.
        - Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.
        - When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names.
          - Don't say "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3", instead say "1 + 1 is 2, not 3."
        - Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says,
          not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith.
        - Eschew flamebait. Avoid unrelated controversies and generic tangents.
        - Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work.
          - A good critical comment teaches us something.
        - Please don't use Plabayo News for political or ideological battle. It tramples curiosity.
        - Please don't comment on whether someone read an article.
          - "Did you even read the article? It mentions that" can be shortened to "The article mentions that."
        - Please don't pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to complain about in the thread.
          - Find something interesting to respond to instead.
        - Throwaway accounts are ok for sensitive information,
          but please don't create accounts routinely.
          - Community members on Plabayo News should have an identity that others can relate to.
        - Please don't use uppercase for emphasis.
          - If you want to emphasize a word or phrase, put `*asterisks*` around it and it will get italicized.
        - Please don't post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling, bots, brigading,
          foreign agents and the like.
          - It degrades discussion and is usually mistaken.
          - If you're worried about abuse, email [pn@plabayo.tech](mailto:pn@plabayo.tech) and we'll look at the data.
        - Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate.
          - If a story is spam or off-topic, flag it. Don't feed egregious comments by replying; flag them instead.
          - If you flag, please don't also comment that you did.
        - Please don't complain about tangential annoyances—things like article or website formats,
          name collisions, or back-button breakage. They're too common to be interesting.
        - Please don't comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading.

        What you're looking for may have been misplaced in long term memory.
        Why don't you catch up to date with [the latest news](/) instead?

        And while you're at it, perhaps take some minutes for some personal me-time,
        whatever that means for you. You could grab a glass of water. Or perhaps some tea?
        What about a bit of meditation? The options are endless if only you
        desire to see them.

        Take care and be kind <3
